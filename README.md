# AdventOfCode2024

This is my attempt to solve the 2024 advent of code in github.
All the inputs will be in a file called "input.txt" in the directory for the current day.
To run the solutions, just use `ocaml day##/part#.ml`.
The input file will be searched in the same directory as the file being executed
